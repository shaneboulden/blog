I'm a Solution Architect at Red Hat, and leverage my skills and expertise in Red Hat OpenShift, platfom engineering, DevSecOps adoption and cloud-native application development to support more secure and scalable solutions for Red Hat's customers.

When I'm not doing any of this, I'm probably in the garden or looking after the chickens.
