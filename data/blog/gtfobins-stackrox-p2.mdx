A few weeks I wrote an article on StackRox and another open source projcet, [GTFOBins](/blog/stackrox-gtfobins). I looked at how you can create a [StackRox](https://www.stackrox.io/) policy from the GTFOBins [source](https://github.com/GTFOBins/GTFOBins.github.io), and use the `roxctl` CLI to scan container images and identify GTFOBins components.

The catalyst for this article was a Microsoft threat intelligence report on cyber threat actors employing "Living off the Land" techniques, and I covered a high-level overview of strategies to mitigate these threats in [another article](/blog/living-off-the-land-containers).

This article builds on the last one, and looks at identifying GTFOBins process execution inside containers at runtime.
