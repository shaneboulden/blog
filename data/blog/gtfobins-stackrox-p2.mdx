A couple of months ago I [wrote an article](/blog/gtfobins-stackrox) on StackRox and another open source projcet, [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io). I looked at how you can create a [StackRox](https://www.stackrox.io/) policy from the GTFOBins [source](https://github.com/GTFOBins/GTFOBins.github.io), and use the `roxctl` CLI to scan container images and identify GTFOBins components.

The catalyst for this article was a Microsoft threat intelligence report on cyber threat actors employing "Living off the Land" techniques, and I covered a high-level overview of strategies to mitigate these threats in [another article](/blog/living-off-the-land-containers). 

This article builds on the last one, and looks at identifying GTFOBins process execution inside containers at runtime. 

## Kubernetes runtime security
Runtime security is often the main concern for organisations operating digital services on Kubernetes, and this was highlighted in the Red Hat State of Kubernetes Security reports over the last few years. The 'State of Kubernetes Security' is a report created by Red Hat that examines the security challenges organizations face when it comes to cloud-native development and how they address these challenges to protect their applications and IT environments. The report is based on surveys of more than 300 DevOps, engineering and security professionals, highlighting how companies are adopting containers and Kubernetes while still balancing the security of these environments. 

Over the last few years we've seen a pretty consistent interest in runtime security. The [2022 State of Kubernetes security report](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/state-kubernetes-security-2022-1) called this out as the number one concern for organisations:

The [2023 State of Kubernetes security report](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/state-kubernetes-security-report-2023) also highlighted runtime security as a significant concern, with nearly half (49%) of organisations surveyed experiencing a security issue at runtime.

Often I find this is where organisations have the most concerns with cloud-native security. They'd usually push an [agent](/blog/access-and-agents) down to protected servers, alerting on anomalous activity or indicators of compromise (IOCs) at runtime. But cloud-native workloads - which are usually running in containers - don't have agents. So how do we monitor workloads at runtime?

One approach that is increasingly being adopted for runtime observability for cloud-native workloads is [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/). eBPF, or extended Berkeley Packet Filter, is a technology that empowers developers to enhance and introspect the inner workings of the Linux kernel in a safe and efficient manner. Originally designed for network packet filtering, eBPF has evolved into a versatile framework for programmable data plane processing. With eBPF, you can write and load custom programs into the kernel, enabling real-time monitoring, tracing, and dynamic network control without requiring kernel modifications. 

eBPF has some really interesting applications for security. Using eBPF we can see and understand all system calls, including system calls from containers. We can also create a packet and socket-level view of network traffic flows, helping to create a baseline of network activity, including network traffic for container applications. This means that we can start to monitor container workloads at runtime, without needing to add additional libraries to the container image, or running an agent on the node. 

There is still discussion about whether BPF/eBPF is the right tool for security monitoring, and there's a really good article from [Brendan Gregg](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2023-04-28/ebpf-security-issues.html). Brendan highlights that, while there are some limitations to using observability tools like eBPF for security monitoring, there is also potential for an awesome eBPF security product. I think that StackRox is well on the way there, and it uses eBPF for runtime security monitoring of container workloads running on Kubernetes.

## StackRox and runtime process execution
During installation StackRox pushes an eBPF program down to nodes to identify processes executing inside containers at runtime, and also identify network traffic flows inside containers. StackRox leverages the [Falco](https://falco.org/) libraries via a [custom fork](https://github.com/stackrox/falcosecurity-libs) to support eBPF.

StackRox also contains a number of pre-built policies to identify anomalous activity at runtime. You can find the complete list of out-of-the-box policies [here](https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/tree/master/pkg/defaults/policies/files), which includes:

* [Detecting netcat execution](https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/blob/master/pkg/defaults/policies/files/exec-netcat.json): Netcat activity could indicate an attacker trying to discover additional services running within a cluster, or trying to move laterally.
* [Detecting binaries that can be used to manipulate network configuration and management](https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/blob/master/pkg/defaults/policies/files/exec-net-tools.json): This could indicate an attacker trying to sniff passwords from the wire, or otherwise discover network traffic.
* [Detecting cryptocurrency mining binaries](https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/blob/master/pkg/defaults/policies/files/exec-mining-binaries.json)
* [Detecting shell as a subprocess of a Java application](https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/blob/master/pkg/defaults/policies/files/exec-java-shell.json): It's pretty unusual for a Java process to spawn a shell, and this activity should be investigated.

## GTFOBins component execution at runtime
Let's look at how we can identify "living off the land" activity at runtime for container workloads. StackRox contains a number of policies that can be used to identify anomalous runtime activity, but I want to create a new policy dedicated to detecting GTFOBins components. 

In the last article I introduced a script that walks the GTFOBins source, and generates a StackRox policy that can detect components in container images. When a container is scanned (either by `roxctl` or in a CI/CD pipeline) the container image components are evaluated, and any GTFOBins components are detected and highlighted. 
```
$ roxctl image check  -e "central-acs-central.apps.cluster1.example.com:443" --insecure-skip-tls-verify --image quay.io/smileyfritz/log4shell-app:v0.5

I've extended this script to now also create a runtime policy for StackRox and GTFOBins components, as well as a deployment-time policy. The script is here:
```python

    return policies

    policy = build_policies("_gtfobins/")
    print(json.dumps({"policies": policy }))
```
When the script is now run it generates two policies; one for GTFOBins components in container images, and one that detects GTFOBins processes executing in a container at runtime.
```
$ python scripts/generate-stackrox-policy.py | jq
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "GTFOBins component in image",
      "description": "Alert on deployments with GTFOBins components present",

      "remediation": "Use your package manager's \"remove\", \"purge\" or \"erase\" command to remove GTFOBins components from the image build for production containers.",
      "disabled": false,

 {
      "name": "GTFOBins component execution detected",
      "description": "Detects contains running a GTFOBins component",
      "rationale": "Leaving GTFOBins components inside container images makes it easier for attackers to 'live off the land' inside a container environment",
      "remediation": "Use your package manager's \"remove\", \"purge\" or \"erase\" command to remove GTFOBins components from the image build for production containers.",
      "disabled": false,
      "categories": [
        "Security Best Practices"
      ],
      "lifecycleStages": [
        "RUNTIME"
      ],
```
Here's a closer look at these two policies:
* **GTFOBins component in image**: This policy targets the `deploy` stage of the container application lifecycle. It means that when a new Kubernetes deployment is created StackRox will first validate whether the container image contains GTFOBins components, via the validting admission controller. If GTFOBins components are detected StackRox will block the deployment, and create a policy violation.

* **GTFOBins component execution detected**: This policy targets the `runtime` stage of the container application lifecycle. This policy will report GTFOBins process executions detected at runtime, via the StackRox eBPF program.

Having both of these policies is important to protect container applications. Ideally we want all GTFOBins components to be caught at the `deploy` stage, and we can prevent these binaries ever being deployed to the platform inside a container workload. But there may be reasons we want to allow some binaries (particular applications need them, debugging, etc). In these instances, we want the monitoring provided by the runtime process to detect and report on GTFOBins execution at runtime.

You can create this new policy by simply running the script (`python scripts/generate-stackrox-policy.py`) and then uploading the policy into StackRox where they'll be available \[I've detailed the process to import policies from JSON into StackRox in the [last article](/blog/gtfobins-stackrox)\].

## Trying it out
Ok - let's try out this runtime policy!

Create a new workload that contains a known GTFOBins component. In this case I'm deploying a container image that I know is vulnerable to a critical CVE, and that also contains a `socat` binary.

```bash
oc new-app quay.io/smileyfritz/log4shell-app:v0.5
```
Once the workload is running, exec into the pod and run the `socat` command:
```bash
oc exec -n devops $(oc get pods -n devops | awk '{if (NR!=1) print $1}') -- /usr/bin/socat
2023/09/07 05:01:13 socat[22] E exactly 2 addresses required (there are 0); use option "-h" for help
```
Ok - the output from the container indicates we ran the `socat` command with no arguments. If the policy is working, you should see a new violation created in StackRox.

Success! We can now detect GTFOBins usage at runtime for container workloads.

## Wrapping up
In this article I expanded on a [previous write-up](/blog/gtfobins-stackrox) by looking at runtime detection of GTFOBins. If you want to take a closer look at eBPF and StackRox there's a great article [here](https://www.stackrox.io/blog/what-is-ebpf/), and I'd highly recommend Brendan Gregg's excellent guide to [learning eBPF Tracing](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2019-01-01/learn-ebpf-tracing.html).
