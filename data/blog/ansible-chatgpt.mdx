[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) has taken my Twitter feed by storm. Did you know that it can create Ansible playbooks too?

### What is ChatGPT
I thought I would let ChatGPT describe itself in its own words.

<Zoom>

ChatGPT can write articles, create code, develop Ansible playbooks (like we'll see below), and also create a Shakespearean verse about a man struggling with a peanut butter sandwich stuck in a VCR.

### Creating Ansible playbooks with ChatGPT

One of the use cases for Ansible that comes up frequently is - "Can I use Ansible to automate TLS certificate expiry checks?"

Let's see how ChatGPT performs creating an Ansible playbook for this task:

Ok - that's actually pretty good! I've got a playbook created, and a description about what each line in the playbook is doing.

This playbook doesn't actually run yet - but we can fix that quickly with ChatGPT!

There is one issue with this playbook. It requires us to connect to every host that we want to validate the certificate for, which isn't ideal. I've made one slight change to delegate to `localhost`, and use the `inventory_hostname` special variable to refer to hosts.

Original playbook from ChatGPT:
```
---
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:

    - name: Check TLS certificate expiration dates
      shell: |
        openssl s_client -connect {{ ansible_host }}:443 -servername {{ ansible_host }} < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates
      register: certificate_dates

    - name: Print certificate expiration date
      debug:
        msg: "{{ certificate_dates.stdout }}"
```

New playbook:
```
---
- hosts: servers
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:

    - name: Check TLS certificate expiration dates
      shell: |
        openssl s_client -connect {{ inventory_hostname }}:443 -servername {{ inventory_hostname }} < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates
      register: certificate_dates
      delegate_to: localhost

    - name: Print certificate expiration date
      debug:
        msg: "{{ certificate_dates.stdout }}"
```

ChatGPT came **so close** to creating this playbook itself:

It works!
```
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory chatgpt_ansible.yml

PLAY [servers] ***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
TASK [Check TLS certificate expiration dates] ********************************************************************************************************************************************
changed: [google.com.au -> localhost]

TASK [Print certificate expiration date] *************************************************************************************************************************************************
ok: [google.com.au] => {
    "msg": "notBefore=Nov 28 08:19:42 2022 GMT\nnotAfter=Feb 20 08:19:41 2023 GMT"
}

PLAY RECAP *******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
google.com.au              : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
```

### Comparing with a human-created playbook
Ok, ChatGPT did a pretty good job. The playbook runs, and outputs certificate validity. Can we do any better?

Here's a basic example that I've come up with, attempting to match the ChatGPT format:
```
---
- name: Check TLS certificate expiration dates
  hosts: servers
  gather_facts: false
  become: no
  tasks:

    - name: Gather facts from localhost
      ansible.builtin.setup:
      delegate_to: localhost

    - name: Get a cert from an https port
      delegate_to: localhost
      community.crypto.get_certificate:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        port: 443
      register: cert

    - name: How many days until cert expires
      debug:
        msg: "Cert for {{ inventory_hostname }} expires in {{ expire_days }} days."
      vars:
        expire_days: "{{ (( cert.not_after | to_datetime('%Y%m%d%H%M%SZ')) - ( ansible_date_time.iso8601 | to_datetime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')) ).days }}"
```

I would argue that this is a more useable Ansible playbook. We've used modules to support the tasks, rather than just 'shelling' out, and we have a certificate variable that we can use to introspect other parameters. Using a specific module also makes it easier to create idempotent playbooks, or handlers to respond to changes.

Importantly though, ChatGPT gave us a great structure for the playbook. This may be all that we need to get started, and then we can substitute Ansible modules for shell commands.

## Wrapping up

ChatGPT performed excellently creating an Ansible playbook that we can use for security automation. It may not have been perfect, but it provided an excellent starting point. Importantly, it gave us a great structure that we can use to improve on.

Give it a try - "Write me an Ansible playbook that patches Windows hosts"!
