summary: 'One of the great things about open source is that we can deeply understand how software behaves. This is even more important for security software, and where we want confidence that an application does what it says. This article looks at how telemetry is implemented in StackRox, and what it means for you as a StackRox user.'

Open source software provides something for security practitioners that proprietary software never can - **validation** and **verification.**

A website may tell you that particular software "never stores or transmits your data" - but how do you know that? Maybe the software developers had good intentions, but their execution was lacking, and they accidentally stored your data in the application database. Or, maybe the website is flat-out lying to you, and your data is being "phoned home" regularly and often.

I think this is even more important for software that provides security capabilities. You need to be able to trust that your data is being handled appropriately, and where you have permitted it to be stored, you should validate and verify that the data collected is what you expect, and it's being anonymised.

How can you test claims and assertions about data protection, if you can't see the code?

[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/advanced-cluster-security-kubernetes) is a Kubernetes-native security platform created from the StackRox open source project. By default RHACS collects telemetry about how users operate and manage the platform, and this is used to improve the service.

I'm not going to provide too much information on what RHACS does, or how it does it. If you want to learn more about RHACS and StackRox you can see some of the other blogs and videos I've creatd previously:

## Exploring StackRox telemetry configuration

The RHACS docs outline [what data is collected by telemetry](https://docs.openshift.com/acs/4.2/telemetry/about-telemetry.html#information-collected-by-telemetry_about-telemetry):

- API, roxctl CLI, and user interface (UI) features and settings to know how Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) is used, which helps prioritize efforts.
- The time spent on UI screens to help improve the user experience.
- The integrations that are used.
- The number of connected secured clusters and their configurations.
- Errors encountered to identify the most common problems.

The docs state that "Telemetry does not collect identifying information such as user names, passwords, or the names or addresses of user resources."

The docs also make a few statements about how telemetry is configured:
- It's enabled by default
- It can be disabled
- It doesn't operate in clusters configured in offline mode (i.e. disconnected or air-gapped clusters)

Let's start digging through the [StackRox code](https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox) and validating this data!

## Exploring where telemetry data is sent


## Verifying and validating telemetry configuration

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) docs state that [telemetry is enabled by default](https://docs.openshift.com/acs/4.2/telemetry/about-telemetry.html#information-collected-by-telemetry_about-telemetry), except when the cluster is configured in `offline mode` to support air-gapped or disconnected environments.. We can verify this in the telemetry config for the [StackRox Central client](https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/blob/master/central/telemetry/centralclient/instance_config.go):

```go 
func getInstanceConfig() (*phonehome.Config, map[string]any, error) {
	if env.OfflineModeEnv.BooleanSetting() {
		return nil, nil, nil
	}
	key, err := phonehome.GetKey(env.TelemetryStorageKey.Setting(),
		env.TelemetryConfigURL.Setting())
	if key == "" || err != nil {
		return nil, nil, err
	}
	...
	return &phonehome.Config{
			ClientID:     centralID,
			ClientName:   "Central",
			GroupType:    "Tenant",
			GroupID:      tenantID,
			StorageKey:   key,
			Endpoint:     env.TelemetryEndpoint.Setting(),
			PushInterval: env.TelemetryFrequency.DurationSetting(),
		}, map[string]any{
			"Image Flavor":       defaults.GetImageFlavorNameFromEnv(),
			"Central version":    version.GetMainVersion(),
			"Chart version":      version.GetChartVersion(),
			"Orchestrator":       orchestrator,
			"Kubernetes version": v.GitVersion,
			"Managed":            env.ManagedCentral.BooleanSetting(),
		}, nil
}
```
This method shows that:
 - If the StackRox 'offline mode' configuration is set, return `nil` parameters for the instance config.
 - Otherwise, configure the telemetry configuration from the storage key setting (we'll cover this a little later)
 - If there was an error in setting up the telemetry configuration, return the error

Great! This looks like it confirms the docs. Telemetry is enabled by default, and is disabled when StackRox is configured in `offline mode`. StackRox also uses this instance configuration to check whether telemetry is enabled:
```go [pkg/telemetry/phonehome/client_config.go]
// Enabled tells whether telemetry data collection is enabled.
func (cfg *Config) Enabled() bool {
	return cfg != nil && cfg.StorageKey != ""
}
```
StackRox exposes a toggle to disable telemetry collection. We can see that this is simply a React page:
```javascript
const PublicConfigTelemetryDetails = ({
    publicConfig,
}: PublicConfigTelemetryDetailsProps): ReactElement => {
    // telemetry will be enabled by default which is why we only check for false here. null/undefined/true will all equate to enabled.
    const isEnabled = publicConfig?.telemetry?.enabled !== false;

    return (
        <Card isFlat data-testid="telemetry-config">
            <CardHeader>
                <CardHeaderMain>
                    <CardTitle component="h3">Online Telemetry Data Collection</CardTitle>
                </CardHeaderMain>
                <CardActions data-testid="telemetry-state">
                    {isEnabled ? <Label color="green">Enabled</Label> : <Label>Disabled</Label>}
                </CardActions>
            </CardHeader>
            <Divider component="div" />
            <CardBody>
                <p className="pf-u-mb-sm">
                    Online telemetry data collection allows Red Hat to use anonymized information to
                    enhance your user experience. Consult the documentation to see what is
                    collected, and for information about how to opt out.
                </p>
            </CardBody>
        </Card>
    );
};
```
This React component also confirms that Telemetry needs to be explicitly disabled - or the system set to offline mode - as it is enabled by default.

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) docs also state that the platform collects information on interactions with the UI. We can see in the [ui/apps/platform/src/global/initializeAnalytics.js](https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/blob/3940bc413eb65f52b793d7e51937be32db36bc39/ui/apps/platform/src/global/initializeAnalytics.js#L51) file that this is supported by the [Segment.com](https://segment.com) JavaScript analytics library.
```
analytics.load = function (key, e) {
	const t = document.createElement('script');
	...
	t.src = `https://cdn.segment.com/analytics.js/v1/${key}/analytics.min.js`;
	...
};
```
Using this library is disabled when telemetry configuration is explicitly disabled, as shown in [useAnalytics.js](https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/blob/3940bc413eb65f52b793d7e51937be32db36bc39/ui/apps/platform/src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts#L3)
```
const useAnalytics = () => {
    const telemetry = useSelector(selectors.publicConfigTelemetrySelector);
    const { enabled: isTelemetryEnabled } = telemetry || ({} as Telemetry);

    const analyticsPageVisit = useCallback(
        (type: string, name: string, additionalProperties = {}): void => {
            if (isTelemetryEnabled !== false) {
                window.analytics?.page(type, name, additionalProperties);
            }
        },
        [isTelemetryEnabled]
    );

    const analyticsTrack = useCallback(
        (event: string, additionalProperties = {}): void => {
            if (isTelemetryEnabled !== false) {
                window.analytics?.track(event, additionalProperties);
            }
        },
        [isTelemetryEnabled]
    );

    return { analyticsPageVisit, analyticsTrack };
};
```
This function is using the React [useCallback]https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback) hook to setup Segment analytics for the UI, and is passing in the `isTelemetryEnabled` flag as a dependency.

So where is the telemetry configured?
