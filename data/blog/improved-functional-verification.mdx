A couple of months ago I published an article on [automating functional verification tests with Ansible.](/blog/functional-verification-ansible) I had several people reach out, and thought that there were some improvements I could make.

If you ran the playbook in the original article you probably saw a message like this when it failed:
```yaml
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory verification.yml

```
There's a few issues with this workflow:
- **The playbook failure is only recorded locally.** There's nothing recorded in other systems that this play has failed, and that we have a security and compliance issue that needs to be investigated.
- **The files used to orchestrate the test are still on the server.** These should be cleaned up, as they are not needed outside the scope of the test.

Fortunately we can use [Ansible blocks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_blocks.html) to improve this workflow.

## Ansible blocks

Ansible blocks help us to handle task errors and failures, and provide a similar approach to "try-catch" statements in many programming languages.

### Rescue blocks
[Rescue blocks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_blocks.html#handling-errors-with-blocks) can be used to run command in response to failures. For example, we could use a `rescue` block to identify when a verification test fails, and create an incident in a system of record (like ServiceNow). To make this easier, there's a certified [ServiceNow Ansible collection](https://www.ansible.com/integrations/it-service-management/servicenow) available for the Ansible Automation Platform.

For our example, we'll simply log a debug message.
```yaml {23-26} showLineNumbers
- name: Improved functional verification tests
  hosts: localhost
  become: no
  remote_user: user1

  tasks:
    - block:
      - name: Collect a file to execute
        ansible.builtin.get_url:
          url: https://github.com/Code-Hex/Neo-cowsay/releases/download/v2.0.4/cowsay_2.0.4_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
          dest: /home/user1/cowsay.tar.gz

      - name: Unarchive the tar-ball
        ansible.builtin.unarchive:
          src: cowsay.tar.gz
          dest: /home/user1/

      - name: Execute the binary
        ansible.builtin.command: "/home/user1/cowsay 'moooooooo'"
        register: cowsay_cmd
        failed_when: cowsay_cmd.rc == 0

      rescue:
        - name: Catch any failures
          ansible.builtin.debug:
            msg: "The verification test failed! You should definitely investigate this."
```
Our playbook now catches failures and creates messages - and could easily be integrated with a platform like ServiceNow.

### Always blocks
[Always blocks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_blocks.html#handling-errors-with-blocks) can be used to clean up after functional verification tests, and remove any content used to perform the test.

We can add an `always` block to the end of our functional verification testing playbook to clean up the `cowsay` files used to orchestrate the test:
```yaml {28-38} showLineNumbers
- name: Even better functional verification tests
  hosts: localhost
  become: no
  remote_user: user1

  tasks:
    - block:
      - name: Collect a file to execute
        ansible.builtin.get_url:
          url: https://github.com/Code-Hex/Neo-cowsay/releases/download/v2.0.4/cowsay_2.0.4_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
          dest: /home/user1/cowsay.tar.gz

      - name: Unarchive the tar-ball
        ansible.builtin.unarchive:
          src: cowsay.tar.gz
          dest: /home/user1/

      - name: Execute the binary
        ansible.builtin.command: "/home/user1/cowsay 'moooooooo'"
        register: cowsay_cmd
        failed_when: cowsay_cmd.rc == 0

      rescue:
        - name: Catch any failures
          ansible.builtin.debug:
            msg: "The verification test failed! You should definitely investigate this."

      always:
        - name: Clean up testing files
          ansible.builtin.file:
            state: absent
            dest: "{{ item }}"
          loop:
            - /home/user1/cowsay
            - /home/user1/cowthink
            - /home/user1/cowsay.tar.gz
            - /home/user1/LICENSE
            - /home/user1/doc
```
And finally, run our new playbook:
```yaml
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory verification.yml

```
Let's break down this improved playbook:
- The playbook will collect a file from GitHub, place it into the user's home directory, and attempt to execute it.
- If the file successfully executes, the playbook fails (`failed_when: cowsay_cmd.rc == 0`) and logs a message. We could also create an incident in [ServiceNow](https://www.ansible.com/integrations/it-service-management/servicenow).
- If the file is blocked (by `fapolicyd`), the playbook succeeds.
- At the end of the playbook, whether it succeeds or not, all of the testing files are removed.

Let me know in the comments if you have any other ideas to improve these functional verification tests, and happy automating!
