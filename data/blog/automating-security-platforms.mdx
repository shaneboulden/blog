Automation is essential to be able to scale security workflows. 

In this article I'm going to be automating a cloud-native security platform, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (ACS). 

I've covered Ansible in a few previous articles, which you can find here:

- [Automating application control](/blog/automating-app-control) - a hands-on guide to automating the File Access Policy Daemon (fapolicyd) with Ansible. The File Access Policy Daemon supports application control on Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems.

- [Automated security patching with Ansible](/blog/automated-patching) - a look at integrating Ansible Automating with Red Hat Insights to detect and remediate critical system vulnerabilities.

## Automating vulnerability management with Ansible

Fortunately, ACS exposes a RESTful API that we can use to automate security workflows. You can find the API documentation by selecting the 'question mark' icon, and then 'API'.

The ACS API exposes an endpoint to manage vulnerabilitis, which you can find under the VulnerabilityManagementService. The API docs provide the syntax we need to use to invoke the service

```
Syntax for API calls
```

Ansible provides a URI module which we can use to invoke this API call.
