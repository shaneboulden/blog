summary: "A recent FortiOS vulnerability is being actively exploited. Ansible can be used to implement a mitigation."
---
I read an interesting article this week that indicated threat actors are [actively exploiting](https://therecord.media/fortinet-warns-of-hackers-targeting-governments-through-vpn-vulnerability/) a FortiOS SSL-VPN buffer overflow vulnerability. The CVE being targeted - [CVE-2022-42475](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42475) affects a large number of FortiOS versions, and appears in the [CISA known exploited vulnerabilities catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).

The recommended remediation here is to patch. There's a number of reasons organisations might take longer to patch, and a short-term mitigation is to disable the SSL-VPN device. In this article I'm going to look at an approach to automate this mitigation.

### Disabling SSL-VPN on Fortigate devices

There's a couple of options to disable SSL-VPN on Fortigate devices. One way I could do this is to simply disable the 'Enable SSL-VPN' connection setting, which you can see here.

This works, but it's pretty clunky. I need to login to each FortiGate appliance and manually configure this to 'disabled'.

Another option is to use [Ansible](https://ansible.com) to automate this configuration consistently across many devices. Ansible provides a collection for automating Fortinet appliances, called `fortinet.fortios`, and there's a module specifically for configuring SSL-VPN settings in Fortinet's FortiOS and FortiGate appliances - `fortinet.fortios.fortios_vpn_ssl_settings`. The docs for this module are [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/fortinet/fortios/fortios_vpn_ssl_settings_module.html)

The `fortinet.fortios.fortios_vpn_ssl_settings` Ansible module doesn't expose the `Enable SSL-VPN` option, but it does allow us to remove the source interface from the SSL-VPN settings. This has basically the same effect - the SSL-VPN is disabled.

### Environment

I'm using the FortiGate 30-day trial available through the AWS marketplace.

The FortiGate AMI is supported with a t2.small instance, which is fine to perform some very basic SSL-VPN config.

### Automating FortiGate SSL-VPN settings with Ansible
Let's put this Ansible collection to the test, and automate the FortiGate mitigation.

Firstly I need to create an inventory:
```ini
[fortigates]
3.26.178.2

[fortigates:vars]
ansible_network_os=fortinet.fortios.fortios
```

Now let's create an Ansible playbook to remove the source interface from the SSL-VPN settings:
```yaml
---
- name: Remove source interface for fortigate SSL-VPN config
  hosts: fortigates
  connection: httpapi
  collections:
    - fortinet.fortios
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    vdom: "root"
    ansible_httpapi_use_ssl: yes
    ansible_httpapi_validate_certs: no
    ansible_httpapi_port: 443
  tasks:
    - name: Remove source port configuration
      fortios_vpn_ssl_settings:
        vdom: "{{ vdom }}"
        vpn_ssl_settings:
          source_interface: []
```

This playbook:
- uses the RESTful API presented by FortiGate devices (`httpapi`)
- removes the source interface for the FortiGate SSL-VPN configuration (sets it to an empty array)

Ok, we're ready to run this playbook. The initial state for our FortiGate appliance has the source interface defined for the SSL-VPN configuration.

<Zoom>
![FortiGate SSL-VPN initial state](/static/images/fortigate-configured.png)
</Zoom>

Let's run the playbook:
```yaml
$ ansible-playbook -i fortigate-inventory -u admin --ask-pass ansible-fortigate.yml
SSH password:

PLAY [Remove fortigate VPN configurations] ***********************************************************************************************

TASK [Remove source port configuration] **************************************************************************************************
changed: [3.26.178.2]

PLAY RECAP *******************************************************************************************************************************
3.26.178.2                 : ok=1    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
```
If we navigate back to the Fortigate UI, we can see that the source interface has been removed.

## Comparing different approaches

There's different ways to disable the SSL-VPN configuration, and I thought I'd ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) for a different opinion:

![ChatGPT FortiGate solution](/static/images/fortigate-chatgpt.png)

Interesting! ChatGPT went with the [fortios_config](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/fortios_config_module.html) module, instead of `fortios_vpn_ssl_settings`.

Unfortunately this module hasn't been maintained since [2017](https://github.com/bjolivot/ansible-module-fortios/blob/master/fortios_config.py), and it's not shipped with the [Fortinet FortiOS Ansible Collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/fortinet/fortios). 

## Wrapping up

In this article I looked at automating short-term mitigations for FortiGate devices with Ansible. I know that lots of organisations use FortiManager already to automate devices like FortiGates, FortiAPs and FortiSwitches, and in another article I'll look at how we can support policy-as-code with FortiManager and Ansible.

Happy automating!
