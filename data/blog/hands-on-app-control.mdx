## Hands-on with Application Control for Linux

Application control is a critical system security control. It's recognised by the [Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/implementing-application-control) as 'one of the most effective mitigation strategies in ensuring the security of systems', and is one of the ['Essential Eight'](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/essential-eight) baseline cybersecurity strategies.

I've written several articles now on application control, and they're linked here for convenience:

- [Application control for everyone](/blog/app-control-for-everyone) - a look at how application control is supported across different platforms, like Linux and Kubernetes, and an introduction to the File Access Policy Daemon (fapolicyd).

- [Application control and integrity checks](/blog/fapolicyd-integrity) - a look at the file integrity controls supported by fapolicyd, and how you can configure one of these.

- [Automating application control](/blog/automating-app-control) - a look at using Ansible to automate application control state across many systems.

One of the most frequent questions I get is - "How can I get started?"

## File Access Policy lab

To make it easier for everyone to get started with application control, I've collaborated with a couple of others at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) to create a hands-on lab. You can find the first release here: https://play.instruqt.com/rhel/tracks/file-access-policy

The lab takes you through installing the File Access Policy Daemon (fapolicyd) on a Linux system, configuring authorised, trusted applications, and performing some basic integrity checking for trusted applications. It's delivered through Instruqt, a platform for delivering virtual hands-on labs, and allows you to provision your own environment for the lab.

I hope you find the lab helpful. I'll be making some changes over the coming months, and please feel free to leave me any feedback here.
