A few weeks ago I wrote an article on [living off the land and containers](/blog/living-off-the-land-containers). It looked at a recent [Microsoft threat intelligence report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/) highligting these techniques, and how containers and Kubernetes naturally help to mitigate this techniques. 

In the article I presented a couple of built-in StackRox policies that detect binaries in container images that are helpful for attackers. For example, policies that detect [curl](https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/blob/master/pkg/defaults/policies/files/curl.json) or [wget](https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/blob/master/pkg/defaults/policies/files/wget.json), which could be used by attackers to pull-down additional capabilities, or probe services to move laterally. One of the questions I received was - "how do you identify which binaries are useful for attackers?" This is where [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) comes in.

## GTFOBins
A lot of 'living off the land' (LOTL) analysis focuses on Windows binaries, and trying to identify those Windows binaries that are helpful for an attacker in hiding payloads, process dumping, downloading files, bypassing UAC keylogging, etc. The term 'LOLBins' ('living off the land binaries') has become commmon to identify these binaries.

The [LOLBAS](https://github.com/LOLBAS-Project/LOLBAS) project has been created to track and identify binaries, scripts and libraries that can be used to support a LOTL strategy. To be included in the list a LOLBin/Lib/Script must:

* Be a Microsoft-signed file, either native to the OS or downloaded from Microsoft.
* Have extra "unexpected" functionality. It is not interesting to document intended use cases.
    * Exceptions are application whitelisting bypasses
* Have functionality that would be useful to an advanced persistent threat (APT) or red team

[GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) is a similar effort to curate Unix binaries that can be used to bypass local security restrictions, and support a LOTL strategy. It's an open source, collaborative project originally created by [Emilio Pinna](https://twitter.com/norbemi) and [Andrea Cardaci](https://twitter.com/cyrus_and) under GPLv3.

## GTFOBins and StackRox
I've created a StackRox policy that can identify GTFOBins-tracked binaries in container images. This policy is generated from the GTFOBins source, and I've created a change [here](https://github.com/GTFOBins/GTFOBins.github.io/pull/395) to include it with the GTFOBins project. Using this policy teams can identify GTFOBins in container images, and take action via StackRox policy enforcement. This could include failing CI/CD pipelines, or using the StackRox Kubernetes admission controller to block deployments referencing these container images.

You can see an example here of StackRox admission control:

Here's the script that generates the StackRox policy:
```python
import json
import os
import re

def get_gtfobins(root):
    root, _, files = next(os.walk(root))
    names = []
    for name in files:
        if not name.endswith('.md'):
            continue
        names.append(re.split("(.*)\.md",name)[1])
    return names
        
def build_policy(root):
    policy = {}

    policy['description'] = "Alert on deployments with GTFOBins components present"
    policy['rationale'] = "Leaving GTFOBins components inside container images makes it easier for attackers to 'live off the land' inside a container environment"
    policy['remediation'] = "Use your package manager's \"remove\", \"purge\" or \"erase\" command to remove GTFOBins components from the image build for production containers."
    policy['disabled'] = False
    policy['categories'] = ["Security Best Practices"]
    policy['lifecycleStages'] = ["BUILD","DEPLOY"]
    policy['eventSource'] = "NOT_APPLICABLE"

    policy['SORTName'] = "GTFOBins component in image"
    policy['SORTLifecycleStage'] = "BUILD,DEPLOY"
    policy['SORTEnforcement'] = False
    policy['policyVersion'] = "1.1"
    section = {}
    section['sectionName'] = "Policy Section 1"
    section['policyGroups'] = []

    for name in names:

    policy['policySections'] = [section]
    policy['mitreAttackVectors'] = []

    # TA0002 - Execution. Many of the GTFOBins components enable execution
    # in various contexts.
    policy['mitreAttackVectors'].append({
        "tactic": "TA0002",

    })

    })

    policy['mitreAttackVectors'].append({

    policy['mitreAttackVectors'].append({

        "techniques": ["T1567"]
    })

    # TA0043 - Reconnaissance. 
    policy['mitreAttackVectors'].append({
        "tactic": "TA0043",
        "techniques": ["T1592"]
    })

    policy['criteriaLocked'] = False
    policy['mitreVectorsLocked'] = False
    policy['isDefault'] = False
    return policy

if __name__ == '__main__':
    policy = build_policy("_gtfobins/")
    print(json.dumps({"policies": [ policy ]}))
```
The StackRox policy generated from this script:
* Is enabled by default
* Applies to the **build** and **deploy** phases of the container application lifecycle. This means that pipelines using `roxctl` to scan containers, or attempts to deploy containers to Kubernetes platforms will be targeted, but containers already running will not.
* Does not include any enforcement actions by default (only reporting violations 'for information')
* Contains a list of GTFOBins components generated from the project source
* Identifies MITRE ATT&CK techniques that align with GTFOBins

Let's build and import this policy into a running StackRox instance. You can run the script directly from the `scripts/` directly in the GTFOBins source tree:
```
$ python scripts/generate-stackrox-policy.py > policy.json
```
You can now upload the policy to StackRox. Here I'm using the downstream, supported version of StackRox, [Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/advanced-cluster-security-kubernetes).

Once the policy is created you can see it by searching for `GTFO`:

## Scanning container images for GTFOBins components
Now that the policy is created we can start scanning container images for GTFOBins components. 
```
roxctl image check  -e "central-acs-central.apps.cluster1.example.com:443" --insecure-skip-tls-verify --image quay.io/smileyfritz/log4shell-app:v0.5
Policy check results for image: quay.io/smileyfritz/log4shell-app:v0.5
(TOTAL: 4, LOW: 4, MEDIUM: 0, HIGH: 0, CRITICAL: 0)

## Wrapping up
[GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) is an awesome, open source curated list of binaries that are very useful to attackers if they can get access to a container image. I've demonstrated an integration here with StackRox that can be used to detect GTFOBins during container image development and deployment, and hopefully ensure that these components are restricted / removed from running containers.

In the next article I'll look at a similar policy for containers at runtime, and how to detect GTFOBins execution at runtime. Stay tuned!
